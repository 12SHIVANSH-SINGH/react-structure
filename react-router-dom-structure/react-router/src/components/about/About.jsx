      Ashes of the Evening The sky turned gray without a sound, As silence fell
      upon the ground. The sun, a ghost behind the veil, Sank slowly down, so
      frail, so pale. Once laughter filled these crooked halls, Now whispers
      haunt the crumbling walls. The clocks still tick, but not for me— They
      measure time too solemnly. A single chair, a shattered frame, A name once
      sweet, now just a name. The wind that brushes through the trees Speaks
      only in forgotten pleas. The fire is out, the coals are cold, No tales
      remain from days of old. The rain taps soft on rusted tin, As though it
      mourns what lies within. Your shadow lingers by the door, Though you don’t
      walk these rooms no more. I call, but echoes mock the tone— They know I’m
      talking to the stone. Each memory, a fading scar Drawn deep across a dying
      star. The photos smile their frozen lie, Yet none can answer when I cry.
      The nights grow long, the colors thin, Regret moves slow beneath the skin.
      A letter torn, a book half-read, The scent of lilacs long since dead. The
      world goes on, or so they claim, But all I see is not the same. The
      children laugh, the churches sing, But none can mend this broken string.
      For once there was a hand in mine, Now all I hold is empty time. No grave
      can house the weight I bear— The grief is everywhere, and nowhere. So let
      the dusk consume the light, I’ve nothing left to give the night. Just me,
      the dust, and one last sigh, A soul too tired to ask why.
